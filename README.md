## ⚠️ Important Limitation

### 🔄 **No Real-time Synchronization**

**Current Major Issue**: The app currently uses **SQLite** for local data storage, which means there is **NO real-time synchronization** between different users' devices.

#### What This Means:
- ❌ **Isolated Data**: Each user can only see their own posted rides and bookings
- ❌ **No Cross-User Visibility**: Passengers cannot see rides posted by drivers on other devices
- ❌ **No Live Updates**: Drivers cannot see real-time bookings from passengers
- ❌ **Single Device Limitation**: All data is stored locally on individual devices
- ❌ **No Shared Database**: Users cannot discover rides from the broader IUT community

#### Real-World Impact:
```

👤 Driver A posts: "IUT → Dhanmondi, 3:00 PM, 3 seats, ৳150"
👤 Passenger B searches: "IUT → Dhanmondi, 3:00 PM"
❌ Result: Passenger B sees "No rides found" even though Driver A's ride exists

```

#### Why This Happens:
- SQLite databases are **device-specific** and **local-only**
- No network communication between app instances
- No centralized server to store and sync ride data
- Each installation creates its own isolated database

## 🚀 Planned Solution: Firebase Migration

### 📅 **Next Development Phase**
The upcoming version will migrate from SQLite to **Firebase Realtime Database** to solve all synchronization issues:

#### ✅ **What Firebase Will Enable**:
- **Real-time Data Sync**: Instant updates across all devices
- **Cross-User Visibility**: All users can see all available rides
- **Live Booking Updates**: Drivers see bookings immediately
- **Cloud Storage**: Secure, scalable data storage
- **Offline Support**: Firebase handles offline/online data sync
- **Push Notifications**: Real-time alerts for bookings and updates

#### 🔄 **Migration Timeline**:
- **Phase 1**: Firebase project setup and configuration
- **Phase 2**: Replace SQLite database calls with Firebase calls
- **Phase 3**: Implement real-time listeners for live updates
- **Phase 4**: Add push notifications and enhanced features
- **Phase 5**: Testing and deployment of Firebase version
